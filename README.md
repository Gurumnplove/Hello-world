# Hello-world
Just random startings
Hey there! It seems that you have landed upon this zone. Well, cool! It's my start of git learning and I hope you will be there with me through the end. It's fun learning together, more than anything you learn better and more when someone else is still facing the same problems as you do :) Enough talk, let's get started!
