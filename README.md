# Hello-world
Just random startings.
Hey there! It seems that you have landed upon this zone. Well, cool! It's my start of git learning and I hope you will be there with me through the end. It's fun learning together, more than anything you learn better and more when someone else is still facing the same problems as you do :) Enough talk, let's get started!

About me:
My name is Guru, Gru as i would like to be called but sadly no one doesn't call me that:). I am a sophomore at IIT Bombay, a dendrophile(google that up!) and an ambivert. Get to know me- I might be awkward at first but eventually, well I will still be the same:).
